# queimadas-br
A visualization to raise awareness about the forest fire destruction in Brazil

## About

This repository intent is to bring a visualization to raise awareness about the destruction that wildfires are bringing to Brazil's ecosystems. 

Brazil is such a huge country that people don't get the idea of how much is being destroyed by just looking at the maps of the areas damaged by the fire. My ideia here is to display the same area but on the place that the person lives. This way they can get the ideia of how huge this damage is. 

The visualization is an interactive map that one can choose a location and it will show the equivalent area that is being destructed on the Pantanal (will include amazon soon)
